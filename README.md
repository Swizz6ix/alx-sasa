ALX-SASA is a project or task tracking app for ALX, inspired by ALX and peculiar to Alx students. 
The name SASA translates to CURRENT in  English Language from Africaâ€™s most spoken indigenous \
language Swahili, giving it that African spirit of tenacity, persistence, ruggedness, doggedness and, originality.


## **Background**
Alx sasa seeks to assist Alx students in keeping track of their current projects as released by alx. 
It uses the digital clocking system and different color combinations at different intervals to communicate \
clearly, the time left in a particular project and help eliminate the confusion or misreading that \
students often experience on the Alx intranet, due to the preferred method chosen by ALX to declare \
time left on each project.

Aside from keeping tabs on current projects, Alx Sasa also endeavors to motivate, inspire, and \ 
stimulate a little sense of humor among students, by providing sections such as motivational quotes, \
trailblazers, and memes sections. These sections empowers students to seamlessly add and share their personal \
motivations, inspirations, and humor among themselves, as a food for thought to guide and encourage them as \
they seek to achieve their common and respective goals.
